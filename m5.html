            <h3 class="blog-post-title">Introduction</h3>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">May 12, 2014 </p>
            <p>Now that we have a working prototype, we want to expand our user testing into real situations where people want to make cards and flyers for each other. This is crucial, because it will test whether the product is actually useful for people. It will also allow us to see whether people like the resulting collages enough to send them to a recipient. This will form the basis for our main driving question in this week’s user study.</p>

            <p>On Thursday’s class, the instructors also underlined a point that had come up for us during user testing - that scaffolding the creative participation of the collaborators is a key part of Card Collage. If a template is unclear or uninspiring, then nobody will want to engage enough to make a nice collage, and the whole project falls apart. It therefore makes sense to present the collaborators with a range of template patterns and see what engages people to take creative photos. We will also ask this question in our follow-up user study interviews.</p>

            <p>To summarize, our main driving question is: <b>Given that the collaborators know they are contributing a collage to a real recipient that they personally know, how authentic is their participation?</b> We hypothesize they will be genuine in their participation, sending pictures that match the template and personal messages.</p>

            <p>In addition, we will also be asking this question in our follow-up interviews: <b>What template would the collaborators have liked to contribute to, in sending a gift for the same recipient?</b> </p>


            <br/>
            <h3 class="blog-post-title">Methods</h3>
            <p>To answer our main driving question, we will assemble three separate groups to each create their own collage for three different recipients.</p>


            <p>The three recipients are Dan’s grandmother Zoia, Dan’s friend Ruth, and Jim’s friend Jonathan. All recipients live far away, which fits with our theme of forming weak connection with people we don’t usually contact. Zoia and Jonathan have birthdays coming up, and Ruth is currently abroad, away from her friends. The collaborators will be family members of Zoia and friends of Ruth and Jonathan respectively. We plan to recruit them by sending them an email message asking them to participate in making a birthday or miss-you message to the recipients. To Zoia and Jonathan, the message will be “Happy birthday, (Name),” and to Ruth it will be “We miss you, Ruth.” The collaborators will collaborate in spelling out a letter with their body to fill into the name tiles as well as leave a personal video or text message. In total, we will gather 13 collaborator data points (one for each letter, minus three since we will start out the first tile).</p>

            <p>We will collect both quantitative and qualitative data points. Quantitatively, we will measure how many times collaborators retake the picture, how long they spend in capturing the personal message, and whether they click through other people’s pictures. Qualitatively, we will measure how closely their picture resemble the letter they are supposed to make and how genuine is their video message.</p>

            <p>After the user study, we will also interview the collaborators about their experience. In particular, we will first ask them about their engagement with the current template. Then we will give them a blank template and ask them to provide us with the template they would feel most engaged in and why.</p>
